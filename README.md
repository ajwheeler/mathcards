# mathcards

This is a script to generate math flash cards.  `julia generatecards.jl` will print a latex doc to stdout that can be comiled into a pdf or postscript file containing several cards per 8.5" x 11" page.

You can use the cards (`cards.pdf`) I generated instead of making your own.

To customize, just edit `generatecards.jl`.
